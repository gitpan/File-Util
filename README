File::Util version 3.14_0
=========================

DESCRIPTION
File::Util provides a comprehensive toolbox of utilities to automate all
kinds of common tasks on file / directories.  Its purpose is to do so
in the most portable manner possible so that users of this module won't
have to worry about whether their programs will work on other OSes
and machines.


CHANGES IN LAST FEW RELEASES
(listed in reverse cronological order by date and subversion)

   3.14_0
      12/27/02, 5:50 pm
      File::Util no longer @ISA Handy::Dandy, and no longer includes it
      as a prerequisite dependency.  Added a little more documentation,
      but it has a _long_ way to go as yet.

   3.13_9
      12/23/02, 3:22 pm
      A few small changes; no longer lists Handy::Dandy::TimeTools as a
      prerequisite dependency.

   3.13_8
      12/22/02, 11:31 pm
      Method File::Util::file_type() now returns a list instead of a single
      string of concatenated keyword substrings, the filetype keywords being:
         plain       text
         binary      directory
         symlink     pipe
         socket      block
         character   tty

      Methods File::Util::load_file() and File::Util::open_handle() both will
      truly guarantee the uniqueness of the underlying file handle which is
      auto-generated, whereas before measures to acheive the uniqueness of
      the filehandles were taken, but not verified.

      POD documentation also got a big update.
