File::Util version 3.14_8
=========================

DESCRIPTION
File::Util provides a comprehensive toolbox of utilities to automate all
kinds of common tasks on file / directories.  Its purpose is to do so
in the most portable manner possible so that users of this module won't
have to worry about whether their programs will work on other OSes
and machines.
