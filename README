File::Util version 3.14_1
=========================

DESCRIPTION
File::Util provides a comprehensive toolbox of utilities to automate all
kinds of common tasks on file / directories.  Its purpose is to do so
in the most portable manner possible so that users of this module won't
have to worry about whether their programs will work on other OSes
and machines.


CHANGES IN LAST FEW RELEASES
(listed in reverse chronological order by date and subversion)

   3.14_1
      1/2/03, 3:47 am
      Added a substantial amount of new documentation.  Spelling errors in
      documentation files corrected.

      Previously available method, File::Util::os(), has been dropped from the
      namespace and is no longer part of the module.

      Method File::Util::file_type() no longer includes the 'tty' keyword among
      its list of recognized file types, as the native Perl file test for
      divining a TTY file can only be used on open file handles.

      The keywords returned by this method are all upper case strings as of
      version 3.13_9, though the release notes for that version errantly did
      not include this statement.  The list of keywords otherwise remains
      unchanged:
         PLAIN       TEXT
         BINARY      DIRECTORY
         SYMLINK     PIPE
         SOCKET      BLOCK
         CHARACTER

   3.14_0
      12/27/02, 5:50 pm
      File::Util no longer @ISA Handy::Dandy, and no longer includes it
      as a prerequisite dependency.  Added a little more documentation,
      but it has a _long_ way to go as yet.

   3.13_9
      12/23/02, 3:22 pm
      A few small changes; no longer lists Handy::Dandy::TimeTools as a
      prerequisite dependency.


INSTALLATION
To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL

On windows machines use nmake rather than make; those running cygwin don't have
to worry about this.  If you don't know what cygwin is, use nmake and check out
<URL: http://cygwin.com/> after you're done installing this module if you want
to find out.
