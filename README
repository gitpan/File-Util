File::Util
=========================

DESCRIPTION
File::Util provides a comprehensive toolbox of utilities to automate all
kinds of common tasks on file / directories.  Its purpose is to do so
in the most portable manner possible so that users of this module won't
have to worry about whether their programs will work on other OSes
and machines.

      Fri May 18 15:42:01 CDT 2007
      Improved error handling mechanism even more, and created 31 new test
      scenarios to make sure that any failure events are handled correctly.

      Fixed some small latent bugs, for example, corrected file handle
      reference verification error handling--checking for validity of
      file handle references.

   3.19
      Wed May 16 18:07:49 CDT 2007
      Documentation.  Documentation.  Documentation.  Small corrections and
      several enhancements.  More examples.

      Improved error-handling mechanism by adding cascading logic to prioritize
      fatality-handling rules of failed calls over the rules of the File::Util
      object, whether they be defaults or manually set up via File::Util::new()
