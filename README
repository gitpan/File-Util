File::Util
=========================

DESCRIPTION
File::Util provides a comprehensive toolbox of utilities to automate all
kinds of common tasks on file / directories.  Its purpose is to do so
in the most portable manner possible so that users of this module won't
have to worry about whether their programs will work on other OSes
and machines.


CHANGES IN LAST FEW RELEASES
(listed in reverse chronological order by date and subversion)

   3.24
      Wed May 23 16:27:20 CDT 2007
      Added method File::Util::last_changed (get inode change time for a file)
      Added method File::Util::touch (works like *nix touch command)

      Both touch and last_changed are autoloaded methods

      Applied patch from S. Muskiewicz that fixes the File::Util::last_modified
      method that was using a similar but incorrect "-" file test operator.

   3.23
      Fri Feb 15 07:34:29 CST 2008
      No major code changes.  Small bug fixes--
      Corrected syntax on package makefile that causes warnings to be
      generated in cases of older Perl versions. Also corrected a problem
      in the documentation where the section "Get the path preceeding a
      file name" was showing incorrect information.

   3.22
      Wed May 23 16:27:20 CDT 2007
      Fixed windows-specific bugs associated with the handling of newlines
      and directory path separators.  Now compatible with Strawberry Perl
      and once again Active$tate Perl for MSWin*.
