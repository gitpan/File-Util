File::Util version 3.16
=========================

DESCRIPTION
File::Util provides a comprehensive toolbox of utilities to automate all
kinds of common tasks on file / directories.  Its purpose is to do so
in the most portable manner possible so that users of this module won't
have to worry about whether their programs will work on other OSes
and machines.


CHANGES IN LAST FEW RELEASES
(listed in reverse chronological order by date and subversion)

   3.18
      Tue Feb 27 15:54:51 CST 2007
      Finished documentation for ALL methods.  Whew!  That was a lot of
      writing.  The documentation will continue to evolve.

      Implemented the --use-sysopen flag for File::Util::open_handle()
      and thereafter the following extra open modes for it (only valid if
      the --use-sysopen flag is used):
         rwcreate
         rwupdate
         rwclobber
         rwappend

      (See the documentation for more details about this new feature).

      Added new method File::Util::release_open_file() for the purpose
      of releasing file locks placed on file handles by the
      File::Util::open_file() method, that is, when file locking is
      NOT turned off.  If file locking is disabled by the user, this new
      method has no effect.

   3.17_*
      Fri Feb 23 - Mon Feb 26
      Developer's releases (testing); not released to the public.

   3.16
      Tue Feb 20 14:16:45 CST 2007
      Fixed problem with method File::Util::make_dir() when used with
      absolute pathnames (path names starting with "/", for example).

      Fixed documentation error concerning the File::Util::list_dir method,
      specifically regarding the "--pattern" option flag.

      Method File::Util::make_dir() now enforces the policy of failing when
      asked to create a directory that already exists as a file of any kind.
      Use the "--if-not-exists" flag if you are counting on the old behavior
      or if you want to create directories which could possibly exist already.

      More documentation added.
