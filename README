File::Util version 3.16
=========================

DESCRIPTION
File::Util provides a comprehensive toolbox of utilities to automate all
kinds of common tasks on file / directories.  Its purpose is to do so
in the most portable manner possible so that users of this module won't
have to worry about whether their programs will work on other OSes
and machines.


CHANGES IN LAST FEW RELEASES
(listed in reverse chronological order by date and subversion)

   3.16
      Tue Feb 20 14:16:45 CST 2007
      Fixed problem with method File::Util::make_dir() when used with
      absolute pathnames (path names starting with "/", for example).

      Fixed documentation error concerning the File::Util::list_dir method,
      specifically regarding the "--pattern" option flag.

      Method File::Util::make_dir() now enforces the policy of failing when
      asked to create a directory that already exists as a file of any kind.
      Use the "--if-not-exists" flag if you are counting on the old behavior
      or if you want to create directories which could possibly exist already.

      More documentation added.	


   3.15
      Fri Dec 22 14:12:45 CST 2006
      Fixed broken test suite that was causing `make test` to fail falsely.
      Revisited documentation, adding a little, and various small improvements.


   3.14_8
      Thu Dec 14 20:13:03 CST 2006
      Fixed some error messages to be more clear.  Tweaked the 
		File::Util::readlimit() method to provide better error messages if 
		called incorrectly.  Modified File::Util::make_dir() to include 
		the --if-not-exists option.

		Fixed a broken test case in "make test" that was causing it to fail
		falsely.

      More documentation added for various methods whose documentation had
      yet to be written.

		Releasing this version as an official release and NOT a developer's
		release only.
